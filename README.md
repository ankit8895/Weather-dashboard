To set up the project, you'll need to follow process step-by-step.

## Step 1: Install Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- You'll need Node.js to run the application and manage packages. You can download it from [nodejs.org](nodejs.org.)
- Git is required to clone the repository. Download and install it from [git-scm.com](git-scm.com)

## Step 2: Clone the Repository

- Go to GitHub and locate the repository containing the React app
- On the repository page, click on the "Code" button and copy the URL provided under "Clone with HTTPS" or "Clone with SSH", depending on your setup
- Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command, replacing <URL> with the URL you just copied:

### `git clone <URL>`

## Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory

After cloning, move into the project directory by running:

### `cd vite-react-app`

Replace 'vite-react-app' with the name of the directory

## Step 4: Install Dependencies

### `npm install`

This command will install all the necessary packages and dependencies defined in the package.json file.

## Step 5: Run the Application

To start the application, run:

### `npm run dev`

This command starts the development server. You should see output in the terminal that includes the URL at which the app is running

## Step 6: Access the App

Open a web browser and navigate to the URL provided by the development server. You should now see the React application running.
